## Dataset                        #already in R

Here, we'll use the built-in R data set named ToothGrowth.
It contains data from a study evaluating the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea pigs.
The experiment has been performed on 60 pigs, where each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
Tooth length was measured and a sample of the data is shown below.

```{r}
# Example dataset
my_data <- ToothGrowth                            #you can cick on the variable to open it
print(dim(my_data)) # print dimension of the data
```

To have an idea of what the data look like:

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
# print the data
head(my_data)                      #The first part
```

```{r}
# Check the structure
str(my_data)
```

```{r}
# Check the structure
my_data$supp                             #levels are the type of data, useful if the number is limited
```

We'll convert dose as a factor variable (i.e., grouping variable) as follow. #It has only two possible values

```{r}
# Convert dose as a factor and recode the levels as "D0.5", "D1", "D2"
my_data$dose <- factor(my_data$dose, 
                  levels = c(0.5, 1, 2),
                  labels = c("D0.5", "D1", "D2"))
head(my_data)
```

## One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

In one-way ANOVA, the data is organized into several groups (or levels) based on one single grouping variable (also called factor variable).
Null hypothesis: the means of the different groups are the same

?? We want to know if there is any significant difference between the average tooth length in the 3 dose levels.

The R function aov() can be used to answer to this question.

```{r}
# Compute the analysis of variance             #one way anova has 2 or more levels
res.aov <- aov(len ~ dose, data = my_data)     #len response varible, dose the independent variable
# Summary of the analysis                      #~ specifies a statistic function where the left is the "target" (dependent) and the right one is the independent variable ("predictors")
summary(res.aov)
```

The output includes the columns F value and Pr(\>F) corresponding to the p-value of the test.
As the p-value is less than the significance level 0.05, we can conclude that there is difference among at least two of the groups

Compute summary statistics (i.e. mean) by groups
```{r}
# report the means and the number of subjects/cell
print(model.tables(res.aov,"means"),digits=3) 
```

Visualize your data

```{r}
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = my_data) 
```

In one-way ANOVA test, a significant p-value indicates that some of the group means are different, but we don't know which pairs of groups are different.

It's possible to perform multiple pairwise-comparison, to determine if the mean difference between specific pairs of group are statistically significant using Tukey multiple pairwise-comparisons.

The function TukeyHD() takes the fitted ANOVA as an argument.

```{r}
# Tukey Significant Differences : why of the average is the different one?
TukeyHSD(res.aov) 
```

The output includes the columns diff value (i.e. difference between means of the two groups) and p adj corresponding to the p-value of the test after adjustment for the multiple comparisons.

Considering a significance level alpha = 0.05, all pairwise comparisons are significant.

## Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

The standard 2-way ANOVA just adds another Independent Variable to the model.
It is used to evaluate simultaneously the effect of two grouping variables.

Null Hypothesis: 1) There is no difference in the means of factor A; 2) There is no difference in means of factor B; 3)There is no interaction between factors A and B

??? We want to know if tooth length depends on supp and dose.

```{r}
# Analysis of Variance: tooth length depends on supp, dose and their combined effect
res.aov2  = aov(len ~ supp + dose + supp*dose, data= my_data) 
# Summary of the analysis
summary(res.aov2)                                    
```

From the ANOVA results, you can conclude that ...

```{r}
print(model.tables(res.aov2,"means"))
boxplot(len ~ supp + dose + supp*dose, data=my_data) 
```

In ANOVA test, a significant p-value indicates that some of the group means are different, but we don't know which pairs of groups are different...

```{r}
TukeyHSD(res.aov2)
```
