## About R Markdown (.Rmd file)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


## Instructions

- Put the .Rmd file and the .tsv file in the same folder.
- Work in a directory within your home directory.
- DO NOT write anything outside the curly brackets.
- DO NOT modify the existing chuck of code.



## Load data

DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE BELOW.

```{r}
# Run this chunk of code to load the raw count data from file "GSE147507_RawReadCounts_Human.tsv"
# The code load the raw count matrix into a data.frame (genes on rows, samples on columns; both rows and columns have names)
# 21797 genes and 69 samples across multiple conditions ("SARS.CoV.2", "Mock", "IAV", ...)
DATA <- read.table("GSE147507_RawReadCounts_Human.tsv", sep="\t", row.names=1, header=TRUE)

# consider only 2 conditions: "SARS.CoV.2" and "Mock"
# get the column indices of Patients (i.e. SARS.CoV.2) and Ctrl (i.e. Mock) samples
indSARS2 <- grep("SARS.CoV.2", colnames(DATA)) 
l1 <- length(indSARS2) # 15 samples
indCTRL <- grep("Mock", colnames(DATA)) 
l2 <- length(indCTRL) # 26 samples

# resize the count matrix to contain only the selected conditions
DATA <- DATA[, c(indSARS2,indCTRL)] # 21797 genes and 41 samples across 2 conditions
print(DATA)
```



## Exercise 1: Write the function MvAplot() 

### Details

The function MvAplot():


takes as input

  - exprData: a numeric data matrix that is supposed to have the same format of the raw count data provided in the .tsv file (i.e. genes’IDs on rows and samples’IDs on columns)
  - pdffilename: the name of the .pdf file where to save the plots


generates a .pdf file with MvA plots of each sample vs. sample 1 (one plot per page). For each plot:

  - Provide meaningful names for the x-axis, y-axis and plot title.
  - Draw a horizontal red line corresponding to the x-axis (i.e. y = 0).
  - Tune the size of the plot and the size/type of the points to make the plot readable.


Notes: 

- If necessary, transform data frames in matrix objects
- Remember you have to work in a directory within your home directory


```{r}
MvAplot <- function(exprData, pdffilename) {
  pdf(pdffilename)
  s1 <- exprData[,1]
  exprData[exprData == 0] <- 1
  for(i in 2:ncol(exprData)){
    print(paste(i, "/ ", ncol(exprData)))
    s_i <- exprData[,i]
    
    M <- log2(s1 / s_i)
    A <- log2(s1* s_i) / 2
    
    plot(A,M, ylab = "M", xlab = "A", main = paste("MvA plot of ", colnames(exprData)[1], " vs ", colnames(exprData)[i]))
    abline(h = 0, col="red")
  }
  while(length(dev.list()) > 0){dev.off()}
 
}
```


### Testing

I will test your code by running your function as follow (DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE BELOW)

```{r}
# uncomment the code to test your code
MvAplot(DATA,"MvAplot.pdf")
```



## Exercise 2: Write the function TMM normalization

### Details

Based on the MvA plot we need to normalize the data. 
You have to complete the function TMMnorm() which is a simplified version with respect to the one implemented during the group exercise.


TMMnorm() takes as input:

 - exprData: a numeric data matrix that is supposed to have the same format of the raw count data provided in .tsv file (i.e. genes’IDs on rows and samples’IDs on columns)
 - Atrim: a vector of 2 elements indicating the lower and upper thresholds to trim the most extreme values of A (where A is the average in log2 scale)
 - Mtrim: a number between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of observations to be deleted from each end (positive and negative values) of the sorted vector M before calculating the mean (where Ms are the log ratios defined as in the MvA plot)


The function TMMnorm() (**READ CAREFULLY... IT IS SIMPLIFIED WITH RESPECT TO THE GROUP EXERCISE!**)

- Calculates the scaling factors SF (with respect to sample 1) by trimming the most extreme values of A and taking the trimmed means of M values (suggestion: use the R function mean())
- Normalizes the data by their scaling factors SF with respect to sample 1
- Returns a list of 2 elements: i) the vector of the scaling factors; ii) the normalized matrix (in the original scale, not in log scale)


```{r}
TMMnorm <- function(exprData, Atrim = c(0,8), Mtrim = 0.02) {
  exprData[exprData == 0] <- 1
  s1 <- exprData[,1]
  scalingF_vector <- rep(0,10)
  scalingF_vector[1] <- 1
  
  for(i in 2:ncol(exprData)){
    si <- exprData[,i]
    A <- log2(s1 * si)/2
    #print(length(A))
    A_index <- which(A >= Atrim[1] & A <= Atrim[2])
    #print(length(A_index))
    M <- log2(s1/si)
    #print(length(M))
    M <- M[A_index]
    #print(length(M))
    
    SF = mean(M, trim=Mtrim, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    exprData[,i] <- si * 2^SF
    scalingF_vector[i] <- 2^SF
  }
  
  return(list(scalingF_vector,exprData))
  
}
```


### Testing

I will test your code by running your function as follow (DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE BELOW)
```{r}
# uncomment the code to test your code
#
outTMM <- TMMnorm(DATA, Atrim = c(0,8), Mtrim=0.02)
# 
 outSF <- outTMM[[1]]
 print(outSF)
# 
 outNormData <- outTMM[[2]]
 print(outNormData[1:5, 1:3])
# 
 MvAplot(outNormData,"Norm_MvAplot.pdf")
```



## Exercise 3: Write the function to perform differenatial expression (DE) analysis with Wilcoxon test

### Details
Now we run a Wilcoxon test between the two groups and 

 - Calculate the p-values (not corrected for multiple testing) between the 2 groups/conditions.
 - Calculate the expected number of false positives (FP), false negatives (FN) and the FDR in correspondence to the given choice of alpha.
 - Calculate q-values using Benjamini-Hockberg procedure.
 - Calculate the log fold change of the (normalized) expression value of Condition A over Condition B, i.e. log2 [(avg normalized gene expression in Condition A) / (avg normalized gene expression of Condition B)].
 

The function DEbyWilcoxon() takes as input

 - normdat: a numeric normalized data matrix that is supposed to have genes’IDs on rows and subjects’IDs on columns
 - groups: a vector of labels corresponding to the columns of the input normalized data matrix (implement the function assuming to have always 2 different labels, i.e. 2 groups/conditions)
 - condition_A: a string containing the name of the label/condition to be used as condition A
 - alpha: the significance level (default 0.05)
 - P0: the % of genes assumed to be NOT DE to be used to calculate the expected FP, FN and FDR


The function DEbyWilcoxon() gives as output a list of two elements

 - A vector of 4 elements with: 
i) the number of selected genes in correspondence to the significance level alpha 
ii) the corresponding estimate of the expected number of false positives (FP) 
iii) the corresponding estimate of the expected number of false negatives (FN)
iv) the corresponding FDR

 - A matrix with 3 columns: p values, q values (obtained with the Benjamini-Hockberg procedure) and log fold change (LFC) of each gene. The matrix must have row names corresponding to the gene names. The matrix must have column names set to c("pval","qval","LFC").

Note: part of the function is already written by me. Write your code only where specifically indicated

```{r}
DEbyWilcoxon <- function(normdat, groups, condition_A, alpha = 0.05, P0=0.8) {
  
  # check that there are only two possible values for the group labels
  lab <- unique(groups)
  if (length(lab) != 2){
    cat("\n Wrong labels", lab)
  }
  
  # get the two labels value
  if(lab[1] == condition_A){ # if the first label is the one correspoding to condition A
    condA <- lab[1]
    condB <- lab[2]
  }else{
    condB <- lab[1]
    condA <- lab[2]
  }
  cat("\n Performing the Wilcoxon test on ", condA, " vs. ", condB, "\n")
  
  # find the indices of normdat columns corresponding to Condition A and Condition B, and put them in variables indA and indB, respectively
  indA <- grep(condA, gsub("\\.", "", colnames(normdat)), ignore.case = TRUE)
  indB <- grep(condA, gsub("\\.", "", colnames(normdat)), ignore.case = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
  
  print(indA)
  print(indB)
  
  # compute the pvalues
  NGENES <- dim(normdat)[1]
  pval <- rep(1, NGENES)
  for (i in (1:NGENES)){# for each gene
    print(paste(i, " / ", NGENES))
    # extract the normalized expression levels of current gene i in Condition A and Condition B
    #print(ncol(normdat))
    #print(nrow(normdat))
    row <- normdat[i,]
    expr_CondA <- row[indA]
    expr_CondB <- row[indB]

    # compute the wilcoxon test and get the pvalue
    pval[i] <- wilcox.test(x = expr_CondA,
                           y = expr_CondB,
                           exact=F,
                           digits.rank =7)$p.val
  }
  
  
  # WRITE HERE THE CODE TO COMPUTE 
  # - THE NUMBER OF SELECTED GENES IN CORRESPONDENCE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL ALPHA
  p_sorted <- sort(pval, decreasing = FALSE, na.last = TRUE)
  p_ranks <- rank(p_sorted, ties.method = "min")
  q_values <- (p_sorted * NGENES) / p_ranks
  q_values <- order(order(pval))
  
  selected_genes_indexes <- which(q_values < alpha)
  selected_genes <- normdat[selected_genes_indexes,]
  
  return_v <- rep(0,4)
  n_selected <- length(selected_genes)
  return_v[1] <- n_selected
  
  
  
  # - THE EXPECTED NUMBER OF FPs, FNs AND THE FDR IN CORRESPONDENCE TO THE GIVEN CHOICE OF ALPHA
  G0   <- P0 * NGENES
  E_FP <- min(n_selected, G0 * alpha)
  E_TP <- max(0, NGENES - n_selected)
  E_TN <- min(NGENES - n_selected,G0 - E_FP)
  E_FN <- NGENES - E_FP - E_TP - E_TN
  
  return_v[2] <- E_FP
  return_v[3] <- E_FN
  
  return_v[4] <- (E_FP/n_selected)
  
  # WRITE HERE THE CODE TO COMPUTE
  return_mat <- cbind(pval, q_values)
  
  logfold <- rep(0, NGENES)
  for(i in 1:NGENES){
    print(paste(i, " / ", NGENES))
    row <- normdat[i,]
    row_A <- row[indA]
    row_B <- row[indB]
    
    
    logfold[i] <- log2((mean(row_A))/(mean(row_B)))
  }
  
  # - THE LOG FOLD CHANGE (Condition A OVER Condition B)
  
  return_mat <- cbind(return_mat, logfold)
  colnames(return_mat) <- c("pval","qval","LFC")
  # WRITE HERE THE CODE TO FORMAT THE RESULTS AS REQUIRED, AND RETURN THEM
  
  return(list(return_v, return_mat))

}
```
